# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a hand gesture recognition system using computer vision techniques to facilitate human-computer interaction. Leveraging the capabilities of Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe, the system can accurately identify and classify various hand gestures in real-time.
# Key Features
Real-time Gesture Detection: The system processes video input to recognize gestures dynamically.
Random Forest Algorithm: Utilizes a Random Forest classifier to achieve robust performance and high accuracy in gesture classification.
User-friendly Interface: Designed for ease of use, enabling seamless interaction with applications and devices through gestures.
# Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
Mediapipe
Random Forest Algorithm
# Usage
Simply point your camera at your hands, and the system will detect and classify gestures based on predefined categories.
